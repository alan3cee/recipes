Stroopwaffles

Waffles
4 1/4 cups/500 g all-purpose flour
1 cup/250 g unsalted butter, melted
1 1/4 cups/150 granulated sugar
4 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/4 cup/ 60 ml lukewarm milk
1 large egg

Filling
1 cup/350 g treacle or molasses
3/4 cup/200 g dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
Pinch of salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Make the waffles: In the bowl of a standing mixer, combine the flour, butter, sugar, yeast, milk and egg. Knead with the dough hook attachment until you have a smooth consistent dough. This mixture can also be kneaded in the bowl by hand if you don't have a stand mixer. Transfer the dough to a greased bowl and loosely covered it with plastic wrap. Set it in a warm place to rise (it won't rise much) for 45 minutes.

Make the filling: Heat the treacle or molasses, brown sugar, butter and cinnamon in a saucpan over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a bubble. When the mixture thickens slightly and the sugar is melted, remove it from the heat.

Preheat a shallow waffle iron (such as a waffle cone, pizzelle, or stroopwafel iron) as directed by the manufacturer's instructions. Knead the dough briefly and divide it into balls the size of a tennis ball (adjust this according to the size of your waffle iron - mine took slightly more dough). Place the ball in the waffle iron and flatten it slightly, then close the lid to cook the waffles until no more steam escapes and the waffle is golden brown.

Remove the waffle carefully with a fork or spatula. Use a round cutter to cut off the edges to make a perfect circle. Carefully split the waffle into two rounds while still hot. Don't wait too long! They'll tear or break if you let them cool before cutting them.

Spread 1 to 2 tablespoons of filling on one of the halves and top with the other half. Repeat with remaining waffles.

Serve the waffles with tea or coffee. Store them in a container that seals air-tight.
